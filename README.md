## Introduction.
If you’re a voracious pleasure reader, you will agree – and probably nod with a wide smile – that nothing really compares to the feeling of turning pages of a printed book. Collecting books is every reader’s pride, and to this end, Amazon has made this possible and affordable. Amazon is the largest online marketplace for print books worldwide. The company controls the majority of the print book market, with the estimates that the company’s share in the market will only grow in the future. It is said that in the USA alone, Amazon sells a whopping _300 million copies_ per year. Each year, certain books are the most purchased and enjoyed by customers.

In this project, I took up the challenge of finding out what factors guided the purchase of the most popular books, ranging from price point to cover type, with everything in between. So, get comfortable, as you would if you were with your favourite book, and read this review.

## Inferences
1. Of all 431 unique books reviewed, the most popular book overall was __StrengthsFinder 2.0__, which appeared __11__ times. This means that the book made the bestsellers' list _every single year_.
2. __Jeff Kinney__ was the author with the most entries across all the bestsellers' lists, with __14__. This was followed by Gallup (11), The College Board (11) and Suzanne Collins (11).
3. __Non-fiction__ was the more popular genre, making up __54.99% (237)__ of all books in the list.
4. The book and author that received the highest average rating of 4.9 most often were __The Food Lab: Better Home Cooking Through Science__ and __Lin-Manuel Miranda__ respectively. 
5. It is seen across the years that Non-fiction was the more popular genre. The outlier here is __2009__, where both genres were equally popular.
6. The most popular cover type overall was __Hardcover__, which was sold in __353__ books. This makes sense, as Hardcovers are generally more durable and protective than its closest type, Paperback.
7. __Where the Crawdads Sing__ was by far the most reviewed book, making its author, __Delia Owens__, the most reviewed author across all the years.
8. Although Non-fiction was the more popular genre by number of books in the overall list, __Fiction (67.24%)__ was the more popular genre by average number of reviews.
